            <h2>My Education</h2>
            <p>I am studying at the best school in my city. I am presently in class 10th. I feel happy to be a part of
                this great school with the good friends, helpful and loving teacher and sound school administration. I
                have extraordinary skills in some subjects whereas I am very weak in the few.No man can do anything in
                the world without aim.</p>

        <div class="step5">
            <h2>My Strengths</h2>
            <p>The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth and try my best not
                to lie. My parents always advised me that if I commit a mistake, I should admit it. I try my best to do
                so. I know how to remain happy in every condition. Because I believe that: “Happiness is not out there;
                it’s in you.”</p>

            <h2>My Weaknesses</h2>
            <p>As every man have weaknesses, so have also. I am a little bit lazy at some places which I do not like.
                While playing time, I pass my lot of time there which is not a good habit, but I try my best to overcome
                my weaknesses.Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man.</p>

            <h2>My hobby</h2>
            <p>In compare to studies, I am good at sports. so I am the captain of my class football team. I am the best
                football player at my school. Besides this, I am a fast runner also and I love athletics. I am in expert
                swimming.The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth and try

            <h2>My Ambition</h2>
            <p>Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man. No man can do anything
                in the world without aim. So, all of us should be very determined about our aim in life.
                Without good career planning, right from the start, one can’t be on the right track.One has to set the
                goals.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One
                needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be
                lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind,</p>
